     ABOUT: <br>
     Cristiano Ronaldo is my favorite footballer and sportsperson. He inspires and motivates me. He has millions of fans around the world. He is the main reason why I started following and playing this beautiful game.

Cristiano Ronaldo
<br>
    <br>
Cristiano has many nicknames. Among fans, he is known by names such as Ronnie, CR7, Cristiano, Ronaldo etc. He is a global icon. There are many reason why I love and admire him.

 <br>

He is regarded by football enthusiasts and pundits as the greatest footballer of all time. He is the most complete player at the moment!

 <br>

Cristiano was born on 5 February, 1985 in Portugal. He had a very normal childhood and upbringing. Since childhood, he showed signs of brilliance. He impressed with his performances at amateur levels.

 

His first step towards professional football came when he signed for Portuguese Club Sporting CP. While at Sporting, he was diagnosed with a medical condition called ‘Racing Heart’. This condition was capable of derailing his footballing career and dreams.

 <br>

A normal person would have been shattered on hearing this bad news. But Cristiano was determined to overcome this hurdle. With the help of his club, he underwent a corrective surgery.

 <br>



 

This was the first big hurdle he overcame in his career! Since then, he has faced various challenges and overcame them with sheer determination, hard work and confidence.
<br>
 

At club level, he has represented famed clubs such as Manchester United and Real Madrid. He is a legend at both these clubs. This shows the level of greatness he has achieved!

 <br>

At both these clubs, he has amassed loads of trophies and individual accolades! League Trophies, Domestic Cups, Champions League, Ballon d’Or, top scorer awards – he has won it all!

 <br>

At International level, he has represented Portugal at various levels. The highlight of his International career came when he captained his side to Euro 2016 title, beating France in their home soil! This earned his the status of ‘Legend’ in Portugal.

 <br>

On field, he is a very demanding player. He wants his teammates to be at their best. He loves to motivate his teammates and bring out their best in field.

 <br>
Cristiano is a true professional. He leads a very disciplined lifestyle. He is known to follow a strict diet and exercise routine. He loves to take care of his body and fitness levels!

 <br>

Some of his traits which I love are – mental toughness, discipline, work ethic, determination and confidence. His confidence is looked upon as arrogance.

 
<br>
He also has good business acumen. Unlike other footballers, he also owns and runs many profitable businesses!
<br>
 

Cristiano Ronaldo is also well known for his philanthropic work. He regularly takes part in social work activities, blood donation campaigns, charity activities etc.

 <br>

On and Off the field, he is an icon and role model. He inspires millions of fans across the world. When he retires, he will go down as one of the greatest footballers of all time!</h2>
